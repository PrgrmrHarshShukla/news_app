# AI News App


## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```

These are the available options to run the app from the output along with a QR Code for Expo Go:
- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), (helps you try out the app directly on your mobile device (Android/iPhone))

Simplest one is:
Scan the QR Code with the Expo Go app from your mobile device and get the app running on your phone.
